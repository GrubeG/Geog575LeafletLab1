    <h2>Growth of Wisconsin's 20 Biggest Cities</h2>
    		<p>Since Wisconsin became a state in 1848, there have been seventeen national censuses taken in the United States. In that time, Wisconsin's population has moved from about 300,000 in 1850 to over 5.6 million in the 2010 census.  </p>
            <p>In 2020, a new census is taking place. I thought it would be interesting to look back at the current largest cities in Wisconsin, tracing their origins back to where they were in the initial census and how they've grown since. </p>
    		<p>All population numbers from U.S. Census Bureau</p>
